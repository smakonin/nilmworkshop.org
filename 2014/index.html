<p id="docs-internal-guid-7e096209-bbe5-b646-044d-1cf2283a3d7b" dir="ltr">The second International Workshop on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) will take place on June 3rd at the University of Texas, Austin, in Austin, TX. This workshop will be held in partnership with Pecan Street, and co-located with <a href="http://wiki-energy.org/2014/04/international-wikienergy-data-conference-2014/">the 2014 International WikiEnergy Data conference</a>.  The event follows a successful first workshop on academic research in NILM, held at CMU in 2012 (more info available at: <a href="http://www.ices.cmu.edu/psii/nilm/">http://www.ices.cmu.edu/psii/nilm/</a>).</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>WORKSHOP MISSION AND OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The mission of this workshop is to create a forum that can unite all the researchers that are working on the topic of energy disaggregation. The main objective of this event is to review the main types of approaches that have been explored to date to solve the problem of electricity disaggregation, and to then discuss possible paths forward knowing what has been tried and what has yet to be experimented. We also intend to have a group discussion about possible solutions to the growing need for standardized datasets and performance metrics that can allow the field to move forward, as well as possible areas of collaboration among different research groups.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>PAPER SUBMISSION</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We invite all researchers working on NILM-related topics to submit 4-page papers to the conference for oral presentation or presentation during a poster session. Papers are due on March 28, 2014, and should be submitted online on the workshop website.  Submissions will be reviewed by a program committee, which will also select papers for presentation or poster sessions.  All submissions must use IEEE style files for LaTeX or Word, available at <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.  All authors will be notified of the decision on papers by <del>April 11</del> April 18, 2014.  We encourage authors to submit papers on research that is ongoing or contains recent results: as the workshop will only include online proceedings, submission to the workshop will not prevent any material from being submitted later to a journal or conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>AGENDA AND PARTICIPATION</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The agenda for the workshop is still being defined, but the current proposal is to have a full-day event including invited speakers, presentations from paper submissions and a poster session. There will be a dinner for those who want to stay and participate in the Pecan Street workshop that will take place the following two days.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>REGISTRATION</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Please register for the event using the RSVP form on the website (<a href="index.html">http://nilmworkshop.org</a>). Participation on this workshop will be free of charge, although we welcome sponsorship support to cover for travel expenses of invited speakers and meals. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact one of the organizers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We look forward to seeing you in Austin on June 3!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regards,<br />
