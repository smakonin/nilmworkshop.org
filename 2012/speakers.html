                <b>Michael Zeifman, Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (CSE)</b><br />
                Dr. Michael Zeifman leads home energy monitoring and modeling work at the Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (CSE), based in Cambridge, MA. CSE is part of the international applied research network spearheaded by Germany's Fraunhofer Society. Prior to joining Fraunhofer CSE, Michael worked in a broadly-defined area of modeling and simulation for more than fifteen years. He has served as a principal investigator on numerous R&amp;D; projects funded either by government (NASA, Department of Defense, NSF, DHS) or industry (FM Global, ERC, NYSearch). He has authored about 50 peer-reviewed scientific and technical papers. Michael received his undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, Russia, and a M.Sc. in Quality Control and a Ph.D. in Physical Reliability from Technion – Israeli Institute of Technology. Dr. Zeifman is a Senior Member of both IEEE and AIAA.
